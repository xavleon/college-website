    description:
      "What's the difference between molarity and molality? They are both measures of concentration, but molarity has to do with volume (in Liters) and molality has to do with mass (in kilograms). Also, molarity talks about the volume of the total solution (solute and solution combined), and molality is about mass of the solute and solvent separately.",
